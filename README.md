## [HardwareSerialMonitor GitHub Repository](https://www.google.com/maps/search/HardwareSerialMonitor+GitHub+Repository)

[HardwareSerialMonitor](https://github.com/koogar/HardwareSerialMonitor) is a Windows-based application developed by Rupert Hirst and Colin Conway (Tallman Labs) designed to transmit PC hardware performance statistics over a serial connection. This tool is particularly useful for displaying real-time system metrics on external microcontroller-driven displays such as those used in Gnat-Stats, Phat-Stats, or Tacho-Stats projects.

### Key Features

* **Real-Time Hardware Monitoring**: Utilizes the OpenHardwareMonitorLib.dll to collect data on CPU, GPU, RAM, and other system components.

* **Serial Communication**: Sends collected data over USB or Bluetooth serial ports, facilitating integration with microcontroller-based displays.

* **Broad CPU Support**: Includes experimental support for various Intel architectures, including Jasper Lake, Rocket Lake, Alder Lake (desktop and mobile), Raptor Lake, Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Panther Lake.

* **Auto-Start Configuration**: Can be configured to launch automatically on Windows startup using a provided VBScript or through Windows Task Scheduler.

### Compatibility

* **Operating Systems**: Compatible with Windows 7, 10, and 11 (64-bit).

* **.NET Framework**: Requires .NET Framework 4.8.

* **Microcontroller Integration**: Designed to work seamlessly with Arduino-based projects like Gnat-Stats and Phat-Stats, which display system metrics on OLED or TFT screens.


### Installation and Setup

* **Installer**: Available as a Windows installer executable.([GitHub][5])

* **Auto-Start Setup**: Instructions are provided for setting up the application to run at startup using either a VBScript shortcut in the Startup folder or by configuring a task in Windows Task Scheduler.

‚úÖ Run HardwareSerialMonitor as Administrator (always):
Locate HardwareSerialMonitor.exe

Right-click ‚Üí Properties

Go to Compatibility tab

Check [‚úî] Run this program as administrator

Click OK

---

## üñ•Ô∏è **Auto-start HardwareSerialMonitor via VBS Script (Startup Folder Method):**

1. Open **File Explorer** and navigate to:

   ```
   %AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
   ```

   *(You can paste this into the address bar and press Enter.)*

2. **Right-click** inside the **Startup** folder ‚Üí select **New ‚Üí Shortcut**

3. In the **location field**, browse to:

   ```
   C:\Program Files (x86)\HardwareSerialMonitor\HardwareSerialMonitor.vbs
   ```

   *(or adjust the path if you installed it elsewhere)*

4. Name the shortcut:

   ```
   HardwareSerialMonitor-Shortcut
   ```

‚úÖ Done!
‚Üí Now, every time Windows starts, `HardwareSerialMonitor.vbs` will run, which in turn launches `HardwareSerialMonitor.exe` on the **last known USB port**.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**

If you moved or installed the app in a different folder, you must **edit `HardwareSerialMonitor.vbs`** in Notepad (or another editor) to update the file path to match your installation directory.

---

Alternatively Auto-Start via Task Scheduler.

### üöÄ **Enable Auto-Start at System Login (via Task Scheduler):**

1. Open **Start Menu** ‚Üí Search for **Task Scheduler** ‚Üí Open it
2. Click **Create Task**

#### **General Tab:**

* **Name**: *(anything you like)*
* Check **\[‚úî] Run only when user is logged on**
* Check **\[‚úî] Run with highest privileges**
* **Configure for**: Windows 10

#### **Triggers Tab:**

* Click **New**
* **Begin the task**: *At log on*
* **\[‚úî] Specific user**: *(select your user account)*

#### **Actions Tab:**

* Click **New**
* **Action**: *Start a program*
* **Program/script**: *Browse to `HardwareSerialMonitor.exe`*

#### **Conditions Tab:**

* *(Optional)* Uncheck **\[ ] Start the task only if the computer is on AC power**

#### **Settings Tab:**

* **\[‚úî] Allow task to be run on demand**
* *(Optional)* **\[‚úî] Stop the task if it runs longer than...** *(set as needed)*

---

‚úÖ Done! Now **HardwareSerialMonitor** will auto-run at login with administrator privileges.
