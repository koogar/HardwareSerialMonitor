#  Installation

Please make sure you have the latest .net 9 runtime installed https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0

Change the COM port number to match your Arduino in appsettings.json (open with notepad)
Note: your Arduino COM port can change if you plug it in a different USB port so you may have to update the appsettings.json in the future

Always run HardwareSerialMonitor_v2.exe as administrator by changing the file properties!!!



To allow HardwareSerialMonitor_v2 to run on Windows startupâ€¦

1) the install location must be C:\Program Files (x86)\HardwareSerialMonitor_v2

2) Goto the Windows "Startup" folder here "%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"


3) Place the .vbs file from the AutoRunOnWindowsStartup folder in the HardwareSerialMonitor_v2 directory, eg. "HardwareSerialMonitor_v2.vbs" (command window)  or "HardwareSerialMonitor_v2Silent.vbs" (Silent operation, no command window) 
in the windows startup folder




Next time Windows runs, HardwareSerialMonitor_v2 will autostart on the last know USB port

Note: 

If you changed/Moved the default installation directory you will need to edit the "HardwareSerialMonitor_v2.vbs" or "HardwareSerialMonitor_v2Silent.vbs" in notepad etc, to reflect those changes
